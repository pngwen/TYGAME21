Day 3 5/23/2020
===============
In this day, we took a detailed look at the graphics functions and modes
and we also started our graphics library.  I also put a lot of effort into
making sure my MSC/C++ environment was working properply and wrote makefiles
for mech wars.  

I experimented a fair bit with modifications to Mech War during my reading.
In order to do this, I had to copy the game library into the day_02 folder.
This is the folder which holds my modified version of the game.

I got a little side tracked in these adventures, and so it really took 
a few days for me to get through day 3!

Exercises
=========
1. Using the game library, write a program which plots a pixel on the screen
   and makes it glow red.
   
   I used dots.c as a basis for this.  Making the red pixel was pretty 
   easy, so I made some additional enhancments.  First, I made it a 3x3 
   square so it would be easier to see.  Second, I made it cycle through
   a few shades of red hoping for a glowing type effect.  It didn't look
   all that great, so perhaps I need to revisit this later on!
   
2. Profile the difference between the two pixel-plotting functions Plot_Pixel
   and Plot_Pixel_Fast().  Hint: write a program that plots 1,000,000 or so
   pixels with each version, and record their speed difference.
   
3. Rewrite the Blit_Char() function so it draws each character in two colors.

4. Write a program that slowly decreases the intesnity of all colors in each
   color register until each register has all zeroes in it.
   
5. Try to make Plot_Pixel_Fast() even faster!

6. Using the keyboard as an input device, try to make a crude drawing 
   program that allows the user to change colors and move a pen on the
   screen.
   
7. Write a program that bounces a single pixel around on the screen
   without leaving a trail.
   
8. Close this book and watch a rerun of Star Trek: The Next Generation!
