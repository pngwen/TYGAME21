Day 3 5/23/2020
===============
In this day, we took a detailed look at the graphics functions and modes
and we also started our graphics library.  I also put a lot of effort into
making sure my MSC/C++ environment was working properply and wrote makefiles
for mech wars.  

I experimented a fair bit with modifications to Mech War during my reading.
In order to do this, I had to copy the game library into the day_02 folder.
This is the folder which holds my modified version of the game.

I got a little side tracked in these adventures, and so it really took 
a few days for me to get through day 3!

Exercises
=========
1. Using the game library, write a program which plots a pixel on the screen
   and makes it glow red.
   
   I used dots.c as a basis for this.  Making the red pixel was pretty 
   easy, so I made some additional enhancments.  First, I made it a 3x3 
   square so it would be easier to see.  Second, I made it cycle through
   a few shades of red hoping for a glowing type effect.  It didn't look
   all that great, so perhaps I need to revisit this later on!
