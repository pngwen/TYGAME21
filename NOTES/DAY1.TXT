============
General overview of video game loops.  Not a bad chapter, should be
fun once we get started!

Workshop
========
Exercises
1.) List the main categories of game types, and try to think of at least
    three games taht fit into each category.

    1.) Doom
    2.) Duke Nukem 3D
    3.) American Mc-Ghee's Alice

    Flying, Driving, or Spaceflight Simulations

    3.) Top Gear 3000

    Sports Games in 2-D or 3-D

    Role-Playing Fantasy Games in 2- or 3-D
    =======================================
    1.) Betrayal at Krondor
    2.) Eye of the Beholder
    3.) Wizardry Series

2.) Draw out and annotate a game loop.
    
    initialize_game()
    while(not game over) {
      game_logic_ai()
      transform_game_objects()
      get_input()
      transform_player()
      render()
      music()
      cleanup()
    }
    exit()

3.) Play the game DOOM for a couple hours and see what can be done with a 
    PC.

    I played the shareware version of doom 1.666 which came on the book's
    CD.  I did not play for a couple of hours.  First, I can beat the first
    episode in far less time.  Second, I have played this many times over
    the past 26 years!  

    However, it was a lot of fun to play the original PC version.  I've
    been playing modern ports of the engine, and so seeing the game in all
    its pixely glory was quite cool.  This is the sort of programming that
    will be fund to play with (Though I will probably do that sort of thing
    when I get to Michael Abrash's stuff.)

4.) Rent a couple science-fiction movies and go spend 10 bucks at an arcade.
    
    I did the 21st century equivalent.  I watched them on Amazon Prime and
    Netflix.  The two science fiction movies I watched were Tank Girl and
    Demolition Man.  Perhaps I should make some sort of survival shooter?

    For the arcade, I used MAME.  I spent $10.00 worth of virtual quarters on
      - Mortal Kombat
      - Mr. Do
      - 1942
      - After Burner
      - Ghosts 'N Goblins
      - Gravitar
      - Double Dragon
    Great fun!

5.) Read your compiler documentation on building libraries and using the 
    libraries to create executable files.

    Done!  It looks fairly straightforward, though sometimes the help system
    does not find files.  Typical microsoft quality!
